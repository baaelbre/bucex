# Architecture

Release 1.2.0 keeps one model compiler, one fitting entry point, and one result
type. Analysis scripts compose these public APIs directly.

## Fit lifecycle

1. `fit()` receives a declarative model and data.
2. The compiler creates semantic states, transitions, and innovation loadings.
3. `inference_plan()` rejects incompatible engine/parameterization choices and
   declares exactness.
4. Prior resolution constructs univariate or hierarchical graphs.
5. The selected engine produces states, parameters, and diagnostics.
6. Results are normalized immediately into `FitResult`.

FS auxiliary paths and signed coefficients never replace the centered
scientific state stored in `FitResult`.

In the general univariate sampler, the prior type and parameterization jointly
select the process-scale update. `InverseGammaVariance` receives its conjugate
full-conditional Gibbs draw in a centered sweep; other centered priors and all
non-centred scale sweeps retain their log-scale MH updates. The public prior API
therefore declares the mathematics without a separate `conjugate` switch.

## Hierarchical sampler

`MultiSeriesModel` compiles named channel blocks. One Gibbs sweep updates:

1. each channel path by Gaussian FFBS, approximate Laplace, or PGAS;
2. channel component allocations;
3. observation parameters;
4. population Dirichlet probabilities;
5. optional shared half-t slab multipliers.

Channels may update concurrently because they are conditionally independent
given hierarchy values. They still retain separate latent paths. The default
componentwise model pools level, slope, and seasonal decisions separately.

## Numerical stability and singular support

Gaussian filtering uses symmetric/Joseph-form covariance operations and
repairs only small round-off eigenvalues. Materially indefinite matrices raise
instead of being silently projected.

Exact SSVS creates deterministic transition directions. PGAS evaluates
ancestor moves on the affine support of active innovations. The conditioned
predecessor is retained when optional candidates are off-support. This is an
algorithmic requirement, not a numerical convenience.

Laplace-MH factors its state update into three reusable operations:

1. deterministically build the final pseudo-Gaussian smoother;
2. draw a complete trajectory from that fixed smoother by FFBS;
3. evaluate `exact log likelihood - pseudo log likelihood`.

The common state prior cancels in the MH ratio, including singular directions.
FS Gaussian filter arrays are cached so repeated `mh_steps` reuse one forward
pass. If the zero FS path crosses a finite GEV endpoint, proposal construction
starts from a deterministic support-feasible path derived without consulting
the current chain trajectory. Approximate `laplace` retains its historical
support-draw loop, while exact `laplace_mh` makes one untruncated proposal per
step and treats endpoint violations as rejections. An unrecoverable numerical
failure in an exact state update aborts the fit before a restored state can be
saved as a new draw.

## Analysis-script lifecycle

The ten files under `examples/` declare models, priors, simulation truths,
fit calls, summaries, and figures in one readable sequence. Seven form the
COMPSTAT analysis; the eighth exposes the centered/inverse-gamma random-walk
benchmark; the final two exercise exact Laplace-MH. Ten matching PBS jobs
invoke those exact files and share a `BUCEX_RUN_ID`; scheduler code does not
define the statistics. Example 08 also exposes reusable functions for one
simulation, prior construction, and one exact fit. Its internal array worker
imports those functions, so the 24-task PBS workflow cannot drift away from
the standalone scientific example. Each worker owns one scenario-chain path
under `tasks/`; the dependent finalizer alone combines fits and writes the
final tables and figures. Reusable
scientific behavior belongs in the core API, while analysis-specific choices
remain visible in the scripts. Examples 08 and 09 deliberately mirror the
scientific contracts and artifact trees of examples 03 and 05, so engine
comparisons do not silently change the data, priors, or summaries.

## Persistence

Schema 2.6.2 archives contain allowlisted JSON metadata plus compressed NumPy
arrays, verify SHA-256 checksums, and load with `allow_pickle=False`. The model
is recompiled from its stored declaration and observations. `warm_start()`
exports one compatible univariate or multiseries draw without changing the
next fit's target. Univariate FS exports include the complete centred path.

## Extension rule

A new component compiles into the common state contract; a new engine consumes
that contract and returns standard result blocks. Cross-channel dependence must
be an explicit observation/transition feature. It must not be hidden inside a
workflow or a prior-pooling label.
