# 1.6.4

Continuous private FS inference, median-matched priors, secular/seasonal observation scale, pooled seasonal copulas, exact bivariate risk quadrature and revised SERRA workflows. See RELEASE_NOTES.md and validation/RELEASE_VALIDATION.md.

# Changelog

## 1.6.3

Added private FS/exact-SSVS inference with joint Gaussian residual copula feedback,
seasonal observation scales, paired predictive comparisons, and concise SERRA
workflows. Preserved scalar APIs and historical archive readers. Corrected the
older mixed hierarchical structural-MH proposal anchor; affected fits need rerunning.
See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for the full scope and `docs/VALIDATION.md` for evidence.

## 1.6.2

Updated all six bundled monthly Uccle series through August 2026 (1,616
months). Extended the existing daily loader and aggregator to accept explicit
sources, use all complete months by default, and optionally export summaries
with a quality report. Daily validation now requires coverage of every compared
month. Full-record configurations use the latest bundled data. One short
preparation script delegates to the package; duplicate dated configurations and
summary copies are removed. See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for the API and migration.
Independent GEV research runs use a zero-shape initial value when permitted by
the configured bounds, avoiding an invalid finite starting endpoint.

## 1.6.1

Consolidated SERRA-only research workflows; optional Gaussian residual copula
with exact likelihood correction; original-scale ordering diagnostics; six
independently runnable univariate analyses; configured reviewer experiments;
90/95/99% held-out calibration and memory-bounded sequential refits. See
`RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `docs/VALIDATION.md` for scope and evidence.

## 1.6.0

Introduced shared components with fixed loadings, weighted zero-sum departures,
centered joint inference, Gaussian reference validation, component/risk/forecast
results and shared-model persistence. Retired particle inference from the
active API. Earlier release archives retain their own detailed history.
